abstract = {Today, much of the interaction between clients and providers has moved to the Internet. Some tricksters have also learned to benefit from this new situation. New improved cons, tricks and deceptions can be found on-line. Many of these deceptions are only profitable if they are done at a large scale. In order to achieve these large numbers of interactions, these attacks require automation. CAPTCHAs/HIPs are a relatively new security mechanism against automated attacks. They try to detect when the other end of the interaction is a human or a computer program (a bot). However, CAPTCHA/HIP design is still in its initial conception as the stream of successful attacks highlight it. This paper focuses on the design of CAPTCHAs and if there is a way in which to assess a basic level of security for new CAPTCHA designs. To do so, we first review main attacks to different types of CAPTCHAs and then, we describe BASECASS, a methodology that can help in avoiding some of these design pitfalls. The application of the methodology is exemplified in three attacks to CAPTCHAs and how following the methodology designers could have avoided them.}

Furthermore, the greater and more complex the system, the higher the benefit but also the less applied: Architectural, computational and complexity limitations have historically ballasted the adoption of predictive maintenance on the biggest systems. This has been especially true in military systems where the security and criticality of the operations do not accept uncertainty. This paper describes the work conducted in addressing these challenges, aiming to evaluate its applicability in a real scenario: It presents a specific design and development for an actual big and diverse ecosystem of equipment, proposing an semi-unsupervised predictive maintenance system. In addition, it depicts the solution deployment, test and technological adoption of real-world military operative environments and validates the applicability.},

This work presents a systematic review of the literature on researches that have been done in recent years to improve energy management systems for smart building using artificial intelligence techniques. An originality of the work is that they are grouped according to the concept of “Autonomous Cycles of Data Analysis Tasks”, which defines that an autonomous management system requires specialized tasks, such as monitoring, analysis, and decision-making tasks for reaching objectives in the environment, like improve the energy efficiency. This organization of the work allows us to establish not only the positioning of the researches, but also, the visualization of the current challenges and opportunities in each domain. We have identified that many types of researches are in the domain of decision-making (a large majority on optimization and control tasks), and defined potential projects related to the development of autonomous cycles of data analysis tasks, feature engineering, or multi-agent systems, among others.}

  abstract = {Most studies about the control, automation, optimization and supervision of building HVAC systems concentrate on the steady-state regime, i.e., when the equipment is already working at its setpoints. The originality of the current work consists of proposing the optimization of building multi-HVAC systems from start-up until they reach the setpoint, making the transition to steady state-based strategies smooth. The proposed approach works on the transient regime of multi-HVAC systems optimizing contradictory objectives, such as the desired comfort and energy costs, based on the “Autonomic Cycle of Data Analysis Tasks” concept. In this case, the autonomic cycle is composed of two data analysis tasks: one for determining if the system is going towards the defined operational setpoint, and if that is not the case, another task for reconfiguring the operational mode of the multi-HVAC system to redirect it. The first task uses machine learning techniques to build detection and prediction models, and the second task defines a reconfiguration model using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. This proposal is proven in a real case study that characterizes a particular multi-HVAC system and its operational setpoints. The performance obtained from the experiments in diverse situations is impressive since there is a high level of conformity for the multi-HVAC system to reach the setpoint and deliver the operation to the steady-state smoothly, avoiding overshooting and other non-desirable transitional effects.}

title={Continuous energy consumption measure approach using a DMA double-buffering technique},
journal={EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking},
year={2021},
number={1},
pages={172},
abstract={Measuring the consumption of electronic devices is a difficult and sensitive task. Data acquisition (DAQ) systems are often used to determine such consumption. In theory, measuring energy consumption is straight forward, just by acquiring current and voltage signals we can determine the consumption. However, a number of issues arise when a fine analysis is required. The main problem is that sampling frequencies have to be high enough to detect variations in the assessed signals over time. In that regard, some popular DAQ systems are based on RISC ARM processors for microcontrollers combined with analog-to-digital converters to meet high-frequency acquisition requirements. The efficient use of direct memory access (DMA) modules combined with pipelined processing in a microcontroller allows to improve the sample rate overcoming the processing time and the internal communication protocol limitations. This paper presents a novel approach for high-frequency energy measurement composed of a DMA rate improvement (data acquisition logic), a data processing logic and a low-cost hardware. The contribution of the paper is the combination of a double-buffered signal acquisition mechanism and an algorithm that computes the device's energy consumption using parallel data processing. The combination of these elements enables a high-frequency (continuous) energy consumption measurement of an electronic device, improving the accuracy and reducing the cost of existing systems. We have validated our approach by measuring the energy consumed by elemental circuits and wireless sensors networks (WSNs) motes. The results indicate that the energy measurement error is less than 5{\%} and that the proposed method is suitable to measure WSN motes even during sleep cycles, enabling a better characterization of their consumption profile.},

Among them, the SYM-H and ASY-H indices represent the (longitudinally) symmetric and asymmetric geomagnetic disturbance of the horizontal component of the magnetic field at midlatitude with a 1-min resolution. Their resolution, along with their relation to the solar wind parameters, makes the forecasting of the geomagnetic indices a problem that can be addressed through the use of Deep Learning, particularly using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this work, we present two DNNs developed to forecast respectively the SYM-H and ASY-H indices. Both networks have been trained using the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) and the related index for the solar storms occurred in the last two solar cycles. As a result, the networks are able to accurately forecast the indices 2 h in advance, considering the IMF and indices values for the previous 200 min. The evaluation of both networks reveals a great forecasting precision, including good predictions for large storms that occurred during the solar cycle 23 and comparing with the persistence model for the period 2013–2020.}

abstract="Autonomous control in robotics hold promising solutions for a broad number of applications. However, autonomous controllers require highly expertise on heterogeneous technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence Planning {\&} Scheduling, behaviour modelling, intelligent execution and the hardware to control. Connecting these technologies entails several challenges to properly synchronize and verify the robot behaviours to deal with real scenarios. In this article, we present an autonomous controller based on high level modelling to easily enable adaptation of the controller to different robotics platforms and application domains. This controller, called MoBAr, allows on-board planning and replanning for goal oriented autonomy. It relies on technologies such as PLEXIL to model the execution behaviours, or the action oriented planning language PDDL for the domain definition and the planning process. Based on these technologies MoBAr enables an easier deployment of the autonomous controller for different robotics platforms. Moreover, MoBAr enables researching in planning systems applied to robotics domains, as it is possible to replace the PDDL planner and/or domain used without much effort. This fact is demonstrated in the experimental section, in which we demonstrate the adaptability and effectiveness of the controller in three different scenarios, i.e., a robotic arm, an office surveillance robot and an exploration rover while exploiting different planning systems.",

A relevant aspect of such planning are the paths that the rover has to to follow to reach the scientific objectives. For path planning, operators use a combination of orbital and surface imagery to analyze the terrain topography to generate a cost map. Applying path planning algorithms over the cost map it is possible to obtain (sub)optimal solutions to safely drive the rover through different waypoints. As well, the paths obtained can be assessed using simulators and handmade improved by means of Virtual Reality techniques. In this paper we present an integrated planner for the mission planning and its evaluation using the recent technological advances in Virtual Reality. We have developed a low cost application to provide a three-dimensional view of the path generated exploiting real Mars surfaces with the aim of helping operators in deciding the best paths to follow.},

Thus, several solutions have been proposed to detect falls, however, none of them achieved a great success mainly because of the need of wearing a recording device. In this paper, we study the use of sound to detect fall events. The advantage of this approach over the traditional ones is that the subject does not require to wear additional devices to monitor his or her activities. Here, we apply machine learning techniques to process sound simulated the most common type of fall for the elderly, i.e., when the foot collides with an obstacle and the trunk hits the ground before using his/her hands to absorb the fall. The results show that high levels of accuracy can be achieved using only a few signal processing techniques.}

However, in real problems unexpected action outcomes may occur and the initial state of the world may not be known with certainty. Incremental contingency planning considers potential failures in a plan and attempts to avoid them by incrementally adding contingency branches to the plan in order to improve the overall probability. The planner focuses on high-probability outcomes and attempts to avoid them by incrementally adding contingency branches to the plan in order to improve the overall probability. Some of these high-probability outcomes might be repairable by runtime replanning so we focus on repairing critical outcomes that cannot be fixed by runtime replanning. For this planning to be successful, we also need high-probability seed plans. In this work, we describe approaches to generating high-probability seed plans and to incremental contingency planning on the critical outcomes.},

  abstract= "Randomness tests are a key tool to assess the quality of pseudo-random and true random (physical) number generators. They exploit some properties of random numbers to quantify to what extent the observed behavior of the tested sequence approximates the expected one. Given the many sides of randomness, there is not an unique test providing the whole picture, instead a suite of tests assessing different aspects randomness. A robust test suite must include independent tests, otherwise tests would assess the same property, providing redundant information. This paper addresses the independence assessment of a popular test suite named Ent. To this end we generate a large number of pseudo-random numbers with different degrees of randomness by evolving them with a Genetic Algorithm. The numbers are generated to maximize their diversity attending different criteria based on Ent output, used as fitness. We encourage diversity by maximizing and minimizing randomness measures. Once a diverse set of pseudo-random numbers is generated, the Ent test suite is run on them, and their statistics studied by means of a classical correlation analysis. The results show high correlation among some statistics used in the literature, which could be overestimating the quality of their randomness source."

New designs are proposed to tackle these security problems while improving the human interface. FunCAPTCHA is the first commercial implementation of a gender classification CAPTCHA, with reported improvements in conversion rates. This article finds weaknesses in the security of FunCAPTCHA and uses simple machine learning (ML) analysis to test them. It shows a side-channel attack that leverages these flaws and successfully solves FunCAPTCHA on 90\% of occasions without using meaningful image analysis. This simple yet effective security analysis can be applied with minor modifications to other HIPs proposals, allowing to check whether they leak enough information that would in turn allow for simple side-channel attacks.}

  abstract = {Autonomous navigation is a research topic that has received considerable attention in robotics. Generally, it is a two step process: (i) generate a global route to the goal and (ii) local motion of the robot along the route. The focus of this paper is on the first part of the process. Some common techniques used are based on heuristic search algorithms that obtain (sub)optimal paths by usually exploiting a rather simplistic terrain representation. Then, the paths generated hardly take into account relevant terrain features, which leads to potentially unsafe paths in realistic environments. This paper presents two contributions: a mathematical formulation for any DTM that can be used by heuristic search algorithms, and a path planning algorithm that generates candidate paths that are safer than the ones obtained by previous approaches. This algorithm, called 3Dana, considers different parameters to maximize the path quality: the maximum slope allowed by the robot and the heading changes during the path. These constraints allow discarding infeasible paths while minimizing the heading changes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed, we present results for different scenarios, which include an evaluation of the algorithm in real Mars DTMs.}

  abstract="The fast technological improvements in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has created new scenarios where a swarm of UAVs could operate in a distributed way. This swarm of vehicles needs to be controlled from a set of ground control stations, and new reliable mission planning systems, which should be able to handle the large amount of variables and constraints. This paper presents a new approach where this complex problem has been modelled as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), and is solved using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). The algorithm has been designed to minimize several variables of the mission, such as the fuel consumption or the makespan among others. The designed fitness function, used by the algorithm, takes into consideration, as a weighted penalty function, the number of constraints fulfilled for each solution. Therefore, the MOGA algorithm is able to manage the number of constraints fulfilled by the selected plan, so it is possible to maximize in the elitism phase of the MOGA the quality of the solutions found. This approach allows to alleviate the computational effort carried out by the CSP solver, finding new solutions from the Pareto front, and therefore reducing the execution time to obtain a solution. In order to test the performance of this new approach 16 different mission scenarios have been designed. The experimental results show that the approach outperforms the convergence of the algorithm in terms of number of generations and runtime.",

  abstract="Due to recent booming of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) technologies, these are being used in many fields involving complex tasks. Some of them involve a high risk to the vehicle driver, such as fire monitoring and rescue tasks, which make UAVs excellent for avoiding human risks. Mission planning for UAVs is the process of planning the locations and actions (loading/dropping a load, taking videos/pictures, acquiring information) for the vehicles, typically over a time period. These vehicles are controlled from ground control stations (GCSs) where human operators use rudimentary systems. This paper presents a new multi-objective genetic algorithm for solving complex mission planning problems involving a team of UAVs and a set of GCSs. A hybrid fitness function has been designed using a constraint satisfaction problem to check whether solutions are valid and Pareto-based measures to look for optimal solutions. The algorithm has been tested on several datasets, optimizing different variables of the mission, such as the makespan, the fuel consumption, and distance.

  abstract={From the last few years the interest and repercussion on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies have been extended from pure military applications to industrial and societal applications. One of the basic tasks to any UAV problems is related to the Mission Planning. This problem is particularly complex when a set of UAVs is considered. In the field of Multi-UAV Mission Planning, some approaches have been carried out in the last years. However, there are few works related to real-time Mission Replanning, which is the focus of this work. In Mission Replanning, some changes in the mission, such as the arrival of new tasks, require to update the preplanned solution as fast as possible. In this paper a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Mission Replanning (MOGAMR) is proposed to handle this problem. This approach uses a set of previous plans (or solutions), generated using an oa liffline planning process, in order to initialize the population of the algorithm, then acts as a complete regeneration method. In order to simulate a real-time system we have fixed a time limit of 2 minutes. This has been considered as an appropriate time for a human operator to take a decision. Using this time restriction, a set of experiments adding from 1 to 5 new tasks in the Replanning Problems has been carried out. The experiments show that the algorithm works well with this few number of new tasks during the replanning process generating a set of feasible solutions under the time restriction considered.},

  reach is the path that it has to follow. In that sense, classical path planning algorithms focus on minimizing the total distance, generally assuming a flat terrain. Newer approaches also include traversability cost maps to define the terrain characteristics. However, this approach may generate unsafe paths in realistic environments as the terrain relief is lost in the discretisation. In this paper we will focus on the path planning problem when dealing with a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). Over such DTM we have developed 3Dana, an any-angle path planning algorithm. The objective is to obtain candidate paths that may be longer than the ones obtained with classical algorithms, but safer. Also, in 3Dana we can consider other parameters to maximize the path optimality: the maximum slope allowed by the robot and the heading changes during the path. These constraints allow discarding infeasible paths, while minimizing the heading changes of the robot. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm proposed, we present the results for the paths obtained for real Mars DTMs.}

Some of these environments are controllable and well-defined, and the tasks to be performed are generally everyday ones. However, exploration missions also enclose hard constraints such as driving vehicles to many locations in a surface of several kilometres to collect and/or analyse interesting samples. Therefore, a critical aspect for the mission is to optimally (or sub-optimally) plan the path that a robot should follow while performing scientific tasks. In this paper, we present up2ta, a new AI planner that interleaves path-planning and task-planning for mobile robotics applications. The planner is the result of integrating a modified PDDL planner with a path-planning algorithm, combining domain-independent heuristics and a domain-specific heuristic for path-planning. Then, up2ta can exploit capabilities of both planners to generate shorter paths while performing scientific tasks in an efficient ordered way. The planner has been tested in two domains: an exploration mission consisting of pictures acquisition, and a more challenging one that includes samples delivering. Also, up2ta has been integrated and tested in a real robotic platform for both domains.}

    abstract = {Human interactive proofs (HIPs) are a basic security measure on the Internet to avoid automatic attacks. There is an ongoing effort to find a HIP that is secure enough yet easy for humans. Recently, a new HIP has been designed aiming at higher security: the Civil Rights Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). It employs the empathy capacity of humans to further strengthen Securimage, a well-known text CAPTCHA. In this paper, we analyze it from a security perspective, finding fundamental design flaws. Using several well-known machine learning (ML) algorithms, we analyze to what extent these flaws affect its security. We discover that thanks to them, we can create a successful side-channel attack. This attack is able to correctly solve the HIP on 20.7\% of occasions, much more than enough to consider it broken. Thus, we show that there is no need to solve the problem of optical character recognition nor empathy analysis for computers to break this particular HIP. ML can be successfully used to break a HIP that uses both with a side-channel attack. This security analysis can be applied to other HIPs. It will allow to test whether they are leaking too much information by unexpected ways, given non-evident design flaws.}

One popular measure used by the EC community is the success rate (SR), which is used alone or as part of more complex measures such as Koza’s computational effort in genetic programming. A common practice in EC is to report just a punctual estimation of the SR, without additional information about its associated uncertainty. We aim to motivate EC researchers to adopt more rigorous practices when working with SRs. In particular, we introduce the importance of correctly reporting this measure and highlight its binomial nature. Unfortunately, this fact is usually overlooked in the literature. Considering the binomiality of the SR opens the whole corpus of binomial statistics to EA research and practice. In particular, we focus on studying several methods to compute SR confidence intervals, the factors that determine their quality in terms of coverage probability and interval length. Due to its practical interest, we also briefly discuss the number of required runs to build confidence intervals with a certain quality, providing a sound method to set the number of runs, one of the most important experimental settings in EC. Evidence suggests that Wilson is, on average, a reliable and simple method to bound an estimation of SR with confidence intervals, while the standard method, which is quite popular because of its conceptual simplicity, should be avoided in any case. However, other methods can also be of interest under certain circumstances. We encourage to report the number of trials and successes, as well as the interval, to ease further comparability of the results.}

This kind of robots represents a great advance in the planetary research that overcomes the performance of the usual rover when operating in rocky and cumbersome areas. We are developing some of the software PTinto requires to autonomously control it and, in particular, the program that simulates its movements on any surface. Up to now we have a graphic computer program, developed in MATLAB, that represents the robot and allow us to check its movements in a lot of detail.

Mobile robots in particular must often operate in any type of terrain. The problem of finding the shortest path on a discretized, continuous terrain has been widely studied, and many applications have been fielded, including planetary exploration missions (i.e. the MER rovers). In this chapter we review some of the most well known path-planning algorithms and we propose a new parameter that can help us to compare them under a different measure: the heading changes and to perform some improvements in any-angle path-planning algorithms. First, we define a heuristic function to guide the process towards the objective, improving the computational cost of the search. Results show that algorithms using this heuristic get better runtime and memory usage than the former ones, with a slightly degradation of other parameters such as path length. And second, we modify an any-angle path-planning algorithm to consider heading changes during the search in order to minimize them. Experiments show that this algorithm obtains smoother paths than the other algorithms tested.}

  abstract="The Multi-UAV Cooperative Mission Planning Problem (MCMPP) is a complex problem which can be represented with a lower or higher level of complexity. In this paper we present a MCMPP which is modelled as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) with 5 increasing levels of complexity. Each level adds additional variables and constraints to the problem. Using previous models, we solve the problem using a Branch and Bound search designed to minimize the fuel consumption and number of UAVs employed in the mission, and the results show how runtime increases as the level of complexity increases in most cases, as expected, but there are some cases where the opposite happens.",

Probably one of the most important ones is the shipping planning, i.e. plan the routes that the shippers have to follow to deliver the goods. In this article, we present an artificial intelligence-based solution that has been designed to help a logistic company to improve its routes planning process. In order to achieve this goal, the solution uses the knowledge acquired by the company drivers to propose optimised routes. Hence, the proposed solution gathers the experience of the drivers, processes it and optimises the delivery process. The solution uses data mining to extract knowledge from the company information systems and prepares it for analysis with a case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm. The CBR obtains critical business intelligence knowledge from the drivers experience that is needed by the planner. The design of the routes is done by a genetic algorithm that, given the processed information, optimises the routes following several objectives, such as minimise the distance or time. Experimentation shows that the proposed approach is able to find routes that improve, on average, the routes made by the human experts.},

It has been successfully used to analyse metaheuristics and stochastic local search algorithms. Some studies on genetic programming and related stochastic search algorithms suggested the existence of a rationale behind the run-time behaviour which could be exploited to better understand the algorithm looking at its run-time response. Under that hypothesis, this paper presents empirical evidence suggesting common statistical properties in the run-time of several types of population-based search algorithms, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, differential evolution or particle swarm optimization. In this analysis, only the run-time of runs that were able to find a solution are considered; unsuccessful runs are not included in the analysis. The run-time to find a solution, measured by the number of evaluations, of some well-known evolutionary algorithms is empirically obtained, finding that it usually can be approximated using a lognormal distribution, with the exception of some difficult problems, which are better approximated by an exponential. We also show that the algorithm parameter settings might influence the yielding run-time statistical distribution; in particular, when there is no selective pressure, the run-time, measured as the number of evaluations to find a solution, follows a Weibull distribution instead of a lognormal one. Finally, we outline a framework using a simple theoretical discrete-time model, showing that the geometrically distributed run-time is a consequence of the lack of memory in the algorithm.},

It consists on a set of locations that should visit in different time windows, and the actions that the vehicle can perform based on its features such as the payload, speed or fuel capacity. In this paper, a temporal constraint model is implemented and tested by performing Backtracking search in several missions where its complexity has been incrementally modified. The experimental phase consists on two different phases. On the one hand, several mission simulations containing (n) UAVs using different sensors and characteristics located in different waypoints, and (m) requested tasks varying mission priorities have been carried out. On the other hand, the second experimental phase uses a backtracking algorithm to look through the whole solutions space to measure the scalability of the problem. This scalability has been measured as a relation between the number of tasks to be performed in the mission and the number of UAVs needed to perform it.},

Using this simplified TCSP model, and a Branch and Bound (B{\&}B) search algorithm, a set of feasible solutions will be found trying to minimize the fuel cost, flight time spent and the number of UAVs used in the mission. Finally, some experiments will be carried out to validate both the quality of the solutions found and the spent runtime to found them.",

Often this uncertainty is represented using probability information on the initial conditions and on the outcomes of actions. In this paper, we describe a novel probabilistic plan graph heuristic that computes information about the interaction between actions and between propositions. This information is used to find better relaxed plans and to compute their probability of success. This information guides a forward state space search for high probability, non-branching seed plans. These plans are then used in a planning and scheduling system that handles unexpected outcomes by runtime replanning. We briefly describe the heuristic, the search process, and the results on different domains from recent international planning competitions. We discuss the results of this study and some of the issues involved in advancing this work further.}

Due to economic and technological constrains, RFID devices are seriously limited, having small or even tiny computational capabilities. This issue is particularly challenging from the security point of view. Security protocols in RFID environments have to deal with strong computational limitations, and classical protocols cannot be used in this context. There have been several attempts to overcome these limitations in the form of new lightweight security protocols designed to be used in very constrained (sometimes called ultra-lightweight) RFID environments. One of these proposals is the David-Prasad ultra-lightweight authentication protocol. This protocol was successfully attacked using a cryptanalysis technique named Tango attack. The capacity of the attack depends on a set of boolean approximations. In this paper, we present an enhanced version of the Tango attack, named Genetic Tango attack, that uses Genetic Programming to design those approximations, easing the generation of automatic cryptanalysis and improving its power compared to a manually designed attack. Experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of this new attack.},

Despite the importance of these metrics, and the doubts that they have generated in many authors, their reliability has attracted little research attention, and is still not well understood. The lack of knowledge about these metrics has likely contributed to the decline in their usage in the last years. This paper is an attempt to increase the knowledge about these measures, exploring in which circumstances they are more reliable, providing some clues to improve how they are used, and eventually making their use more justifiable. Specifically, we investigate the amount of uncertainty associated with the measures, taking an analytical and empirical approach and reaching theoretical boundaries to the error. Additionally, a new method to calculate Koza's performance measures is presented. It is shown that these metrics, under common experimental configurations, have an unacceptable error, which can be arbitrary large in certain conditions.}

Given two points in a map, path-planning algorithms search for a path that joins those two points, avoiding obstacles. It is a challenging problem with important practical applications in a wide range of applications: autonomous mobile robotics, logistics or video games, just to mention some of them. Given its importance, it has attracted much research, resulting in a large number of algorithms, some classical, such as A*, other more specialized, such as swarms. However, despite all the literature dedicated to this problem, the statistics used to analyze experimental results in most cases are naïve. In this paper, we position in favor of the need of incorporating stronger statistical methods in path-planning empirical research and promote a debate in the research community. To this end, we analyze some 2D-grid classical path-planning algorithms in discrete domains (i.e. A* and A* with post-processing) and more recent algorithms in continuous domains (i.e. Theta* and S-Theta*). Given the differences of these algorithms, we study them under different criteria: Run-time, number of heading changes, number of expanded vertices and path-length.}

    abstract = {The path-planning problem for autonomous mobile robots has been addressed by classical search techniques such as A* or, more recently, Theta* or S-Theta*. However, research usually focuses on reducing the length of the path or the processing time. The common practice in the literature is to report the run-time/length of the algorithm with means and, sometimes, some dispersion measure. However, this practice has several drawbacks, mainly due to the loose of valuable information that this reporting practice involves such as asymmetries in the run-time, or the shape of its distribution. Run-time analysis is a type of empirical tool that studies the time consumed by running an algorithm. This paper is an attempt to bring this tool to the path-planning community. To this end the paper reports an analysis of the run-time of the path-planning algorithms with a variety of problems of different degrees of complexity, indoors, outdoors and Mars surfaces. We conclude that the time required by these algorithms follows a lognormal distribution.}

  abstract = {In the last two decades, an increasing attention has been dedicated on the use of high level task planning in robotic control, aiming to deploy advanced robotics systems in challenging scenarios where a high autonomy degree is required. Nevertheless, an interesting open problem in the literature is the lack of a well defined methodology for approaching the design of deliberative systems and for fairly comparing different approaches to deliberation. This paper presents the general idea of an environment for facilitating knowledge engineering for autonomy and in particular to facilitate accurate experiments on planning and execution systems for robotics. It discusses features of the On-Ground Autonomy Test Environment (OGATE), a general testbench for interfacing deliberative modules. In particular we present features of an initial instance of such system built to support the GOAC robotic software.}

  abstract={This paper presents recent results on applying advanced autonomous reasoning capabilities for a planetary rover concept for synthesizing complete command plans that involve a wide assortment of mission requirements. Our solution exploits AI scheduling techniques to manage complex temporal and resource constraints within an integrated power-aware decision-making strategy. The main contributions of this work are the following: (i) we propose a model of the world inspired by the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission concept, a long-range planetary exploration scenario; (ii) we introduce a MSR-inspired scheduling problem called Power Aware Resource Constrained Mars Rover Scheduling (PARC-MRS), and we present an extension of a well-known constraint-based, resource-driven reasoner that returns rover activity plans as solutions of the PARC-MRS; (iii) we present a benchmark instance generator used to create reproducible PARC-MRS problem sets on the basis of the rover models' specifications contained within the ESA's 3DROV simulator; finally, (iv) we conduct an exhaustive experimentation to report the quality of the generated solutions according to both feasibility and makespan optimization criteria.},

It is focused on studying the time required by an algorithm to find a solution, the expected run-time, which is one of the most relevant algorithm attributes. Previous research has associated the expected run-time in GP with the lognormal distribution. In this paper we provide additional evidence in that regard and show how the algorithm parametrization may change the resulting run-time distribution. In particular, we explore the influence of the selective pressure on the run-time distribution in tree-based GP, finding that, at least in two problem instances, the lack of selective pressure generates an expected run-time distribution well described by the Weibull probability distribution.}

  abstract = {Clustering is one of the most versatile tools for data analysis. Over the last few years, clustering that seeks the continuity of data (in opposition to classical centroid-based approaches) has attracted an increasing research interest. It is a challenging problem with a remarkable practical interest. The most popular continuity clustering method is the Spectral Clustering algorithm, which is based on graph cut: it initially generates a Similarity Graph using a distance measure and then uses its Graph Spectrum to find the best cut. Memory consuption is a serious limitation in that algorithm: The Similarity Graph representation usually requires a very large matrix with a high memory cost. This work proposes a new algorithm, based on a previous implementation named Genetic Graph-based Clustering (GGC), that improves the memory usage while maintaining the quality of the solution. The new algorithm, called Multi-Objective Genetic Graph-based Clustering (MOGGC), uses an evolutionary approach introducing a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to manage a reduced version of the Similarity Graph. The experimental validation shows that MOGGC increases the memory efficiency, maintaining and improving the GGC results in the synthetic and real datasets used in the experiments. An experimental comparison with several classical clustering methods (EM, SC and K-means) has been included to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.}

Specifically, we explore, from a broad perspective, how the collaboration of a group of people can increase the performance on a simple target identification task. To this end, we requested a group of people to identify the location and color of a sequence of targets appearing on the screen, and measured the time and the accuracy of the response. The individual results are compared to a collective identification result determined by simple majority voting, with random choice in case of drawn. The results are promising, as the identification becomes significantly more reliable even with this simple voting, and with a small number of people (either odd or even) involved in the decision. In addition, the paper briefly analyzes the role of brain-computer interfaces in collaborative targeting, extending the targeting task by using a BCI instead of a mechanical response.}

  abstract = {This paper explores means to increase efficiency in performing tasks with multi-robot teams, in the context of natural Human-Multi-Robot Interfaces (HMRI) for command and control. The motivating scenario is an emergency evacuation by a transport convoy of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) that have to traverse, in shortest time, an unknown terrain. In the experiments the operator commands, in minimal time, a group of rovers through a maze. The efficiency of performing such tasks depends on both, the levels of robots' autonomy, and the ability of the operator to command and control the team. The paper extends the classic framework of levels of autonomy (LOA), to levels/hierarchy of autonomy characteristic of Groups (G-LOA), and uses it to determine new strategies for control. An UGVoriented command language (UGVL) is defined, and a mapping is performed from the human-friendly gesture-based HMRI into the UGVL. The UGVL is used to control a team of 3 robots, exploring the efficiency of different G-LOA; specifically, by (a) controlling each robot individually through the maze, (b) controlling a leader and cloning its controls to followers, and (c) controlling the entire group. Not surprisingly, commands at increased G-LOA lead to a faster traverse, yet a number of aspects are worth discussing in this context.}

  abstract = {The path-planning problem for autonomous mobile robots has been addressed by classical search techniques such as A* or, more recently, Theta*. However, research usually focuses on reducing the length of the path or the processing time. Applying these advances to autonomous robots may result in the obtained “short” routes being less suitable for the robot locomotion subsystem. That is, in some types of exploration robots, the heading changes can be very costly (i.e. consume a lot of battery) and therefore may be beneficial to slightly increase the length of the path and decrease the number of turns (and thus reduce the battery consumption). In this paper we present a path-planning algorithm called S-Theta* that smoothes the turns of the path. This algorithm significantly reduces the heading changes, in both, indoors and outdoors problems as results show, making the algorithm especially suitable for robots whose ability to turn is limited or the associated cost is high.}

This type of analysis has been successfully used in some Artificial Intelligence (AI) fields, in paticular in Metaheuristics. This paper is an attempt to bring this tool to the path-planning community. In particular, we analyse the statistical properties of the run-time of the A*, Theta* and S-Theta* algorithms with a variety of problems of different degrees of complexity. Traditionally, the path-planning literature has compared run-times just comparing their mean values. This practice, which unfortunately is quite common in the literature, raises serious concerns from a methodological and statistical point of view. Simple mean comparison provides poorly supported conclusions, and, in general, it can be said that this practice should be avoided.
			After our analysis, we conclude that the time required by these three algorithms follows a lognormal distribution. In low complexity problems, the lognormal distribution looses some accuracy to describe the algorithm run-times. The lognormality of the run-times opens the use of powerful parametric statistics to compare execution times, which could lead to stronger empirical methods.},

The cognitive control architecture aims to control Ptinto in order to autonomously explore the environment. The architecture is structured as a three layer system, using a planning and scheduling component with long-term memory and basic learning possibilities, and an executor that implements some reactive behavior. The simulation suite is specifically adapted to the geometric features and dynamics of this particular robot.

These measures, mainly computational effort and number of individuals to be processed, estimate the performance of the algorithm as well as the difficulty of a problem. Although Koza's performance measures have been widely used in the literature, their behaviour is not well known. In this paper we study the accuracy of these measures and advance in the understanding of the factors that influence them. In order to achieve this goal, we report an empirical study that attempts to systematically measure the effects of two variability sources in the estimation of the number of individuals to be processed and the computational effort. The results obtained in those experiments suggests that these measures, in common experimental setups, and under certain circumstances, might have a high relative error.}

Often this uncertainty can be characterized in terms of probability distributions on the initial conditions and on the outcomes of actions. These distributions can be used to guide a planner towards the most likely plan for achieving the goals. This work is focused on developing domain-independent heuristics for probabilistic planning based on this information. The approach is to first search for a low cost deterministic plan using a classical planner. A novel plan graph cost heuristic is used to guide the search towards high probability plans. The resulting plans can be used in a system that handles unexpected outcomes by runtime replanning. The plans can also be incrementally augmented with contingency branches for the most critical action outcomes.",

  abstract = {This work focuses on developing domain-independent heuristics for probabilistic planning problems characterized by full observability and non-deterministic effects of actions that are expressed by probability distributions. The approach is to first search for a high probability deterministic plan using a classical planner. A novel probabilistic plan graph heuristic is used to guide the search towards high probability plans. The resulting plans can be used in a system that handles unexpected outcomes by runtime replanning. The plans can also be incrementally augmented with contingency branches for the most critical action outcomes. This abstract will describe the steps that we have taken in completing the above work and the obtained results.}

The success of these platforms will continue to increase while they are able to offer tools and services to improve users' social relationships. The rapid evolution of social networks, the growing business opportunities and the possibility to apply new techniques to a relatively unexplored domain, have awakened strong interest among researchers. The potential benefits have generated the need to be the first one to achieve an enough level of autonomy to provide customized services for both users and product providers.
      
      But the true revolution will arrive when social networks become "smart". To build these new intelligent systems we propose to use Artificial Intelligence techniques, more concretely plan recognition. In this paper we propose an architecture able to recognize the users intentions from partial observations of their actions. In addition, we present three scenarios where our system can be useful: Online commercial intentions, adaptive user interfaces and identity theft and extortion detection.

These techniques can be used to help users who have to go to a building with several floors, corridors, and departments to get its right location and orientation. The problem gets more complicated when there are a high number of visitors with temporal constraints. Typically the lack of information and signs to guide the user complicates this task. A typical example is a hospital, where patients have scheduled doctor's appointments and in some cases movement problems (handicaps). A possibility for solving this problem is to equip the building with an intelligent system for user detection and orientation.

These techniques allow the company to separate the daily incidents that generate noise in the routes, from the decision made based on the knowledge of the route.

Although they provide a powerful and flexible notation to define and retrieve patterns from text, the syntax and the grammatical rules of these regex notations are not easy to use, and even to understand. Any regex can be represented as a Deterministic or Non-Deterministic Finite Automata; so it is possible to design a representation to automatically build a regex, and a optimization algorithm able to find the best regex in terms of complexity. This paper introduces both, a graph-based representation for regex, and a particular heuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm based on grammatical features from this language in a particular data extraction problem.}

They are able to efficiently exploit historical information in the evolution process to look for optimal solutions or approximate themfor a given problem, achieving excellent performance in optimization problems that involve a large set of dependent variables. Despite the excellent results of GAs, their use may generate new problems. One of them is how to provide a good fitting in the usually large number of parameters that must be tuned to allow a good performance. This paper describes a new platform that is able to extract the Regular Expression that matches a set of examples, using a supervised learning and agent-based framework. In order to do that, GA-based agents decompose the GA execution in a distributed sequence of operations performed by them. The platform has been applied to Language induction problem, for that reason the experiments are focused on the extraction of the regular expression that matches a set of examples. Finally, the paper shows the efficiency of the proposed platform (in terms of fitness value) applied to three case studies: emails, phone numbers and URLs. Moreover, it is described how the codification of the alphabet affects to the performance of the platform.},

The problem gets even worst when there are a big number of users and they have time constraints. A typical example is a medical centre where the patients have got scheduled doctor's appointments and, in some cases, severe movement difficulties. A possibility for solving this problem is to provide the building with an intelligent system for user detection and orientation. In addition, this strategy would allow to find and locate all the people inside the building and to carry out an individual search if it were necessary. This is the framework we have chosen in this article. We have developed a complete hardware and software system for people detection, location and orientation in this scenario. The hardware part of the system is based on the RFID technology and it has been successfully implemented in a fully operational prototype. The software uses artificial intelligence techniques, specifically planning and scheduling. }

  abstract = {AI planning and scheduling are two closely related areas. Planning provides a set of actions that achieves a set of goals, and scheduling assigns time and resources to the actions. Currently, most of the real world problems require the use of shared and limited resources with time constraints when planning. Then, systems that can integrate planning and scheduling techniques to deal with this kind of problems are needed.
  
  This paper describes the extension performed in PIPSS (Parallel Integration Planning and Scheduling System) called PIPSS*. PIPSS combines traditional state space heuristic search planning with constraint satisfaction algorithms. The extension is based on heuristic functions that allows the planner to reduce the search space based on time estimations that imposes temporal constraints to the scheduler. The purpose is to achieve a tighter integration respect to the previous version and minimize the makespan. Results show that PIPSS* outperforms state of the art planners under the temporal satisficing track in the IPC-08 competition for the tested domains.}

  abstract = {Over the past 20 years, there has been much work in the area of model-based diagnosis (MBD). By this we mean diagnosis systems arising from computer science or artificial intelligence approaches where a generic software engine is developed to address a large class of diagnosis problems. Later, models are created to apply the engine to a specific problem. These techniques are very attractive, suggesting a vision of machines that repair themselves, reduced costs for all kinds of endeavors, spacecraft that continue their missions even when failing, and so on. This promise inspired a broad range of activity, including our involvement over several years in flying the Livingstone and Livingstone 2 on-board model-based diagnosis and recovery systems as experiments on two spacecraft. While a great deal was learned through a variety of applications to simulators, testbeds and flight experiments, no project adopted the technology in operations and the expected benefits have not yet come to fruition. This led us to ask what are the costs of using MBD for the operational scenarios we encountered, what are the benefits, and how do we approach the question of whether the benefits outweigh the costs? How are missions today approaching fault diagnosis and recovery during operations? If we characterize the cost and benefits of using MBD, how would it compare with traditional ways of making a system more robust? How did expectations for MBD compare to benefits seen in the field and why? The literature does provide existing cost models for related endeavors such as integrated vehicle health management. It also provides excellent narratives of why projects chose not to use MBD after considering it. However, we believe that this paper is the first to unpack and discuss the cost, benefit and risk factors that impact the net value of model-based diagnosis and recovery. We use experience with systems such as Livingstone as an example, so our focus is on-board model-based diagnosis and recovery, but we believe many of the insights and remaining questions on the costs and benefits are applicable to other diagnosis applications. Quantitative model of when on-board model-based diagnosis would be an effective choice, it lays out the cost/benefit proposition and identifies several disconnects that we believe prevent adoption as an operational tool. While we do not suggest metrics for every cost, benefit and risk factor we identify, we do discuss where each factor arises in development or operations and how model-based diagnosis and recovery tends to leverage or exacerbate each. As such we believe the analysis is of use to those developing MBD or related techniques and those who may employ them. It also serves as one example of how honest expectations based on technical capability can come to differ from the net impact on customer problems. In this paper we present a cost/benefit analysis for MBD, using expectations and experiences with Livingstone as an example. We provide an overview of common techniques for making spacecraft robust, citing fault protection schemes from recent missions. We lay out the cost, benefit and risk advantages associated with on-board MBD, and use the examples to probe each expected advantage in turn. We conclude our analysis with a summary of our method for analyzing the costs and benefits in a particular domain, and encourage others to come forward with analyses of costs and benefits for fielded systems. Finally, we discuss related work both in terms of similar analyses and fielded systems.}

DynJAQ integrates case-based knowledge into a graph-based representation that can be easily learned and managed. The combination of both case-based knowledge and graphs allows it to implement a flexible hierarchical structures (or learning graphs) that have been applied to implement a new kind of Frequently Asked Questions Systems. In these systems the output is dynamically built from the user query, using as basis structures the knowledge retrieved from a Case Base.

  abstract = {One of the main obstacles in applying AI planning techniques to real problems is the difficulty to model the domains. Usually, this requires that people that have developed the planning system carry out the modeling phase since the representation depends very much on a deep knowledge of the internal working of the planning tools. On some domains such as business process reengineering (BPR), there has already been work on the definition of languages that allow non-experts entering knowledge on processes into the tools. We propose here the use of one of such BPR languages to enter knowledge on the organisation processes to be used by planning tools. Then, planning tools can be used to semi-automatically generate business process models.
  
  As instances of this domain, we will use the workflow modeling tool shamash, where we have exploded its object oriented structure to introduce the knowledge through its user-friendly interface and, using a translator transform it into predicate logic terms. After this conversion, real models can be automatically generated using a planner that integrates planning and scheduling, IPSS. We present results in a real workflow domain, the telephone installation (TI) domain.}

Rather than enforcing separate deliberation and execution layers, IDEA unifies them under a single planning technology. Deliberative and reactive planners reason about and act according to a single representation of the past, present and future domain state. The state obeys the rules dictated by a declarative model of all relevant aspects of the domain - the subsystem to be controlled, internal control processes of the IDEA agent, and interactions with other agents. We present IDEA concepts — modeling, the IDEA core architecture, the unification of deliberation and reaction under planning — and illustrate its use in a simple example.

  abstract = {Recently, the areas of planning and scheduling in artificial intelligence (AI) have witnessed a big push toward their integration in order to solve complex problems. These problems require both reasoning on which actions are to be performed as well as their precedence constraints (planning) and the reasoning with respect to temporal constraints (e.g., duration, precedence, and deadline); those actions should satisfy the resources they use (scheduling). This paper describes IPSS (integrated planning and scheduling system), a domain independent solver that integrates an AI planner that synthesizes courses of actions with constraint-based techniques that reason based upon time and resources. IPSS is able to manage not only simple precedence constraints, but also more complex temporal requirements (as the Allen primitives) and multicapacity resource usage/consumption. The solver is evaluated against a set of problems characterized by the use of multiple agents (or multiple resources) that have to perform tasks with some temporal restrictions in the order of the tasks or some constraints in the availability of the resources. Experiments show how the integrated reasoning approach improves plan parallelism and gains better makespans than some state-of-the-art planners where multiple agents are represented as additional fluents in the problem operators. It also shows that IPSS is suitable for solving real domains (i.e., workflow problems) because it is able to impose temporal windows on the goals or set a maximum makespan, features that most of the planners do not yet incorporate}

  abstract = {Satellite domains are becoming a fashionable area of research within the AI community due to the complexity of the problems that satellite domains need to solve. With the current U.S. and European focus on launching satellites for communication, broadcasting, or localization tasks, among others, the automatic control of these machines becomes an important problem. Many new techniques in both the planning and scheduling fields have been applied successfully, but still much work is left to be done for reliable autonomous architectures. The purpose of this article is to present CONSAT, a real application that plans and schedules the performance of nominal operations in four satellites during the course of a year for a commercial Spanish satellite company, HISPASAT. For this task, we have used an AI domain-independent planner that solves the planning and scheduling problems in the HISPASAT domain thanks to its capability of representing and handling continuous variables, coding functions to obtain the operators' variable values, and the use of control rules to prune the search. We also abstract the approach in order to generalize it to other domains that need an integrated approach to planning and scheduling.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a knowledge representation that allows building hierarchical structures that can be used to build dynamically solutions to solve a particular user question. The goal of this work is to show how it is possible to define (and handle) a new knowledge representation that allows the integration of Case-based Knowledge into a graph-based representation that can be easily learned and managed. The combination of both, Case-based Knowledge and graphs allows to implement a flexible hierarchical structures (or learning graphs) that have been applied to implement a new kind of Frequently Asked Questions Systems. In these systems the output is dynamically built from the user query, using as basis structures the knowledge retrieved from a Case Base. The paper shows how the management of these cases allow enriching the knowledge base. Finally, the paper shows a specific application of this technique, in particular a Web system named DynJAQ (Dynamic Java Asked Questions). DynJAQ is a FAQ system that is able to generate dynamically several HTML guides that can be used to answer any possible question about a particular programming language (Java).},
